# 🧠 LeetCode Problem Solving – Java Edition

Welcome to my **LeetCode Journey**!  
This repository is my personal collection of Java-based solutions to coding problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), designed to sharpen my skills, improve problem-solving speed, and master DSA fundamentals 💻🚀.

---

## ⚡ Why This Repo?

- 🚀 Build strong DSA & algorithmic thinking.
- 🧠 Practice recursion, string manipulation, array logic, and more.
- 💡 Document approaches, logic, and learning.
- 📈 Track progress and consistency.

---

## 💡 What You'll Find

- ✅ Clean, readable Java solutions
- 🔁 Multiple approaches (e.g., recursion vs loop)
- 📘 Commented code with logic explanation
- ✍️ My thought process & strategy
- 🔍 Problems I solved multiple ways for better understanding

## 📊 Problem Tags Covered

| Tag               | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 🔁 Recursion       | Solve problems recursively with base + small problem approach |
| 🔤 String          | Manipulating substrings, characters, and patterns |
| 🔢 Array           | Index-based logic and element handling |
| 🎯 Two Pointers    | Fast-slow pointer strategies         |
| 🔍 Binary Search   | Search in sorted arrays or conditions |
| 🧩 Pattern Matching| Substring search, KMP-style logic    |
| 📦 Hashing         | HashMap, HashSet for frequency and lookup |

## 📈 Progress Highlights

- 🔥 Recently Solved: `strStr()` using recursion with index tracking
- 🔄 Improved Logic: `countAbc()` using both recursion and loop
- 💪 Building confidence in:
  - Writing base cases
  - Thinking recursively
  - Breaking large problems into smaller patterns
